# hello-world
sample repository

this is a sample repository created to use and get familiarised with github. Git is a version control system and Github works with git.
To start with, install/update git in your system. Create a user(user.add) and add your email (user.email). This username and email will be
associated with any commits made from git. Now, create an ssh public pvt key pair from git bash. Then, create an account in github.com. This is just a simple sign up. Once signed up, login to gitub.com and copy the public key created earlier from git and add the key in your github account. Done.
